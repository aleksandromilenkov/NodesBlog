# NodesBlog
I created NodeJS and Express app for rendering blogs from MongoDb database with Mongoose.  
You can add new blog as well.  
This project is for learning purposes.  
I created this project with the MVC design pattern.  
I'm using EJS for handling the views, I have one controller - the blog controller and I have one model that is blog model.  
The app is hosted live here: https://rich-jade-shark-sock.cyclic.app
